# Vanilla Toast
A toast library for vanilla lovers :heartpulse:.

## Why vanilla toast?
Well, with all the amount of frameworks out there, it's become overwhelming. They are great tools, yes, but the abstraction is crazy and I did not get a change to learn about the lower level APIs like EventSource, Websocket, Clusters for concurrency, ArrayBuffers, etc. That's why I decided to make this toast library to make my life easier when I develop client-side apps with Vanilla JavaScript.

This library will be up to ARIA accessibility standards as much as possible. The few uses implemented already are:

- role attributes
- aria-live attributes
- prefers-reduced-motion listener

## Features
- Dependency Free
- Customizable
- Follows the ARIA Conventions as much as possible
- Built in animations, such as:
  - popup
  - fade-in
  - slide-down
  - slide-left
  - slide-right
  -slide-up
